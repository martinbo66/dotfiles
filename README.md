# martinbo66’s dotfiles

This project contains the dotfiles and custom shell scripts that I use on my Mac.

Why keep them at GitHub? It’s a way to share advanced shell tips with other developers, and more practically, a way to back up my configuration. When I get a new Mac or (knock on wood) need to recover from lost data or a corrupt OS, I can simply clone this repository and immediately be back in business.

I (Bo) forked [Matt Brictson's](https://github.com/mattbrictson/dotfiles) dotfiles, which contains this attribution.

Thank you [Ryan Bates](https://github.com/ryanb/dotfiles), [thoughtbot](http://github.com/thoughtbot/dotfiles) and [Tom Ryder](https://github.com/tejr/dotfiles) for the inspiration.

## Requirements

Before using these dotfiles there are a few things you'll need to install manually:

1. Your Mac needs git and Apple’s command-line developer tools.
2. Homebrew.
3. Rbenv.

My blog post here has a walkthrough: https://mattbrictson.com/rails-osx-setup-guide

## What’s included?

### Sublime Text 3 settings and packages

For consistency with dotfiles for other apps, I put my Sublime Text 3 configuration in `~/.sublime`. To ensure that Sublime Text can find this directory, I symlink `~/Library/Application Support/Sublime Text 3/Packages/User` to it. The installation rake task (see below) takes care of setting this up for you. Here's what my dotfiles specify for Sublime:

* Settings optimized for Rails development
* Better auto-complete behavior
* Custom key bindings

#### Packages

* AdvancedNewFile
* All Autocomplete
* ApplySyntax
* Clipboard Manager
* CloseOtherWindows
* Color Highlighter
* DashDoc
* DocBlockr
* Emmet
* Gem Browser
* Git
* GitGutter
* Indent XML
* Markdown Preview
* Marked App Menu
* nginx
* Pretty JSON
* Sass
* Shell Command
* SSH Config
* SublimeLinter
* SublimeLinter-annotations
* SublimeLinter-json
* SublimeLinter-rubocop
* SublimeLinter-ruby
* Terminal

### Handy scripts

These scripts will be installed to `~/.bin` and added to your `$PATH`:

* `brew-install` installs and updates my standard suite of homebrew recipes. Run it on a new machine after installing homebrew to get all the recipes needed for Rails development, node, PostgreSQL, etc.
* `bucket` is a simple command-line interface for Bitbucket, most notably providing a way to create pull requests. Run `bucket --help` for details.
* `defaults-install` uses `defaults write` on OS X to change system default behavior to my liking: e.g. don't include drop-shadows on screenshots.
* `git-pluck` adds the `pluck` command to git, which is a trick for cherry-picking a commit from another repository into the current one: `git pluck ../other-repo SHA`.
* `git-reap` adds the `reap` command to git, which deletes local and remote branches that have already been merged with the master branch and thus are no longer needed.
* `ruby-install` is a convenient wrapper around `rbenv install` that does some easy-to-forget housekeeping before and after installation. Usage: `ruby-install 2.1.2`.
* `sup` uses SSH to update packages on one or more Ubuntu servers (assuming you have root access to them). In other words, `sup SERVER1 SERVER2` will SSH as root into both servers and run the appropriate `aptitude` commands to safely update all packages. It will also report whether any daemons need to be restarted for the updates to take effect.

### Shell enhancements (bash)

* Customizes the shell prompt with current directory and git status: e.g. `~/Work/dotfiles (master *%)$`.
* Replaces `diff` with `colordiff`.
* Prettifies `ls` output and adds `l`, `la`, and `ll` shortcuts.
* Improves default `top` settings.
* Allows bash command history to be navigated with up and down arrow keys.
* Makes bash auto-completion case-insensitive.
* Sets up necessary homebrew, rbenv, and python virtualenv shell variables.
* Specifies `less` as the default pager and Sublime Text (`subl`) as the default editor.
* Sets better defaults for the `psql` command.

### Git configuration

* Sets up a reasonable global gitignore file to ignore things like `.DS_Store`, `Icon?`, and `*sublime-project`.
* Enables color output and line-ending checks.
* Shortens common commands: `di`, `co`, `ci`, `br`, `l`.
* Defines somes useful aliases:
    * `git hist`
    * `git ignored-files`
    * `git untracked-files`
    * `git unstage`

In addition, during installation (see below), you will be prompted for your full name and email address, which are automatically added to the git config file.

### Ruby/rails stuff

* Adds an `r` command that serves as a shortcut for running `bin/rake` or `bin/rails`. It's pretty smart, so `r s` will expand to `bin/rails server`, and `r db` will expand to `bin/rake db:console`. No more fat-finger mistakes of `rails` vs `rake`!
* Disables gem documentation generation so that `gem install` runs much faster.
* Uses my [rails-template](https://github.com/mattbrictson/rails-template) when running `rails new`.
* Configures the `xray` gem to use Sublime Text.
* Enables command history (use up and down arrows) in `irb`.
* Defines a list of useful gems that are installed by default whenever a new version of ruby is installed via `rbenv install`.


## Installation

Choose a place to store the dotfiles, like `~/Code/dotfiles`.

```
git clone git://github.com/mattbrictson/dotfiles ~/Code/dotfiles
cd ~/Code/dotfiles
```

Run one of the three installation options:

```
rake install:dotfiles # Install the dotfiles and scripts
rake install:packages # Install homebrew packages and Mac defaults
rake install          # Install all of the above (recommended)
```

### Changing your bash version

Some features of the dotfiles only work with bash version 4.2. After installing bash via homebrew (which `rake install:packages` does for you), enable it as your shell as follows:

1. Add `/usr/local/bin/bash` to `/etc/shells`
2. Change your shell to `/usr/local/bin/bash` by running `chsh`
